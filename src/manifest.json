Drill down into each backup and inspect its contents. Give each milestone backup a descriptive name, and it becomes safe from automatic garbage collection. Restore any combination of windows and/or individual tabs. Grant the extension permission to access incognito windows, and they are fully supported for both backup and restore!",
